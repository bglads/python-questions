A palindrome is a word that is spelled the same backward and forward, like “noon”
and “redivider”. Recursively, a word is a palindrome if the first and last letters are the same and the
middle is a palindrome.

The built-in function eval takes a string and evaluates it. Check its 'help' output.

A Caesar cypher is a form of encryption that involves “rotating” each letter by a fixed number of places. To rotate a letter means to shift it through the alphabet, wrapping around
to the beginning if necessary, so ’a’ rotated by 3 is ’d’ and ’z’ rotated by 1 is ’a’.
Define a function that takes a string and an integer as parameters, and returns a new string that contains the letters from the original string rotated by the given amount.
